\usage{
plsko_filter(
  X,
  y,
  q = 0.05,
  method = "lasso.lcd",
  offset = 0,
  nb.list = NULL,
  threshold.abs = NULL,

  seed = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{A numeric matrix or data frame of predictors.}

\item{y}{A numeric vector or factor of responses.}

\item{q}{A numeric value specifying the false discovery rate (FDR) level. Default is `0.05`.}

\item{method}{A string specifying the method to compute test statistics. Options are `"lasso.lcd"`, `"lasso.logistic"`, `"lasso.max.lambda"`, `"RF"`. Default is `"lasso.lcd"`.}

\item{offset}{A numeric or string value to adjust the knockoff threshold. Default is `0` (control modifed FDR). Other options include `1` (yields a slightly more conservative procedure ("knockoffs+") that controls the FDR according to the usual definition) and `"both"` (returns results from both "knockoffs" and "knockoffs+").}

\item{nb.list}{Optional. A list of length \eqn{p} or adjacency matrix of \eqn{p \times p} that defines the neighbourship of variables. A list of length \eqn{p} should include the neighbours' index of each variable from \eqn{X_1} to \eqn{X_p} in order; The \eqn{i^{th}} element in the list includes the indices of the neighbour variables of \eqn{X_i}, or \code{NULL} when no neighbours. A adjacency matrix should be symmetric with only binary element and  where \eqn{M_{ij} = 1} when \eqn{X_i} and \eqn{X_j} is defined as neighbours; otherwise \eqn{M_{ij} = 0} when not neighbour or on diagonal (i.e. \eqn{i = j}). If not provided or NULL, the neighborhoods are determined based on correlations.}

\item{threshold.abs}{Optional. A value between \eqn{0} and \eqn{1}. A numeric value specifying an absolute correlation threshold to define neighborhoods. If not provided, the function uses \code{threshold.q}.}

\item{threshold.q}{Optional. A numeric value between 0 and 1 indicating the quantile of the correlation values to use as a threshold.}

\item{ncomp}{Optional. An integer specifying the number of components to use in the PLS regression. Default is \code{NULL}, the \code{ncomp} is determined empirically by \eqn{PC_p1} criterion.}

\item{sparsity}{Optional. A numeric value between 0 and 1 specifying the sparsity level in the PLS regression. Default is 1 (no sparsity).}

\item{seed}{An integer seed for reproducibility. Default is 1.}
}
\value{
An object of class "knockoff.result". This object is a list containing at least the following components:
\describe{
  \item{`call`}{The matched call.}
  \item{`statistic`}{The computed test statistics `W` of length \eqn{p}.}
  \item{`threshold`}{The knockoff threshold used to determine discoveries.}
  \item{`selected`}{The named vector of selected variables.}
